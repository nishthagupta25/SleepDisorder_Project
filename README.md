# 🌙 **Sleep Disorder Prediction System**

### AI-Based Tool for Predicting Sleep Disorders 💤
*This project is an AI-powered system that predicts sleep disorders, including Insomnia, Sleep Apnea, and Narcolepsy based on user input data such as health habits, sleep patterns, and mood journaling.*


## ✨ **Features**

🛌**Sleep Disorder Prediction**: Predicts potential sleep disorders based on user data. \
🔍**Health and Sleep Data**: Users input information like age, gender, sleep duration, stress levels, exercise habits, and more for accurate predictions.\
📓**Mood Journaling**: Users can write personal entries about their daily mood and experiences. These entries are stored in a `journals.txt` for tracking mood over time.
  

## 💻 **Tech Stack**

- **Flask**: Web framework for handling the application’s backend.
- **Scikit-learn**: Python library for building and deploying the machine learning models.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Model for predicting sleep disorders.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Model used for improving prediction accuracy.
- **Python File Handling**: To store mood journal entries in `journals.txt`.


## 🖊️ **Mood Journal Feature**

- Users can write daily journal entries about their mood, stress, sleep quality, or anything else they wish to track.
- These journal entries are saved in a file called `journals.txt` for future reference.
- The journal helps users keep track of their mental and emotional state over time, contributing to a more personalized diagnosis.
